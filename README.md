# Introduction

The wiki is built with MkDocs and GitHub Pages.
It supports inline PlantUML diagrams.

Inspired by [wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) & [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/).

## Workflow

For editing the wiki I currently use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I'm also experimenting with [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) and [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) as a alternative.

After commit & push the new page will be build trough GitHub Actions. Currently I'm using GitHub Pages to serve the website files, but I'm also experimenting with Cloudflare Pages.

## Using the wiki
