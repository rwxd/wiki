# Introduction

The wiki is built with MkDocs and GitHub Pages.
It supports inline PlantUML diagrams.

Inspired by [wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) & [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/).

## Workflow

For editing the wiki I currently use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). After commit & push the new page will be created and published trough GitHub Actions. An detailed explanation how that works can you find [here](blog-gh-pages-mkdocs.md).

## Using the wiki

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the tree view to the left.
