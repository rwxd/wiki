# Introduction

The wiki is built with MkDocs and GitHub Pages.

It is inspired by [wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) & [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/).

## Workflow

For editing the pages I currently use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Using the wiki
