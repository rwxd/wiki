# What is a stack?
A stack is a data structure used to store a collection of objects.
Individual items can be added and  stored in a stack using a push operation. Objects can be retrieved using a pop operation, which removes an item from the stack.

When an object is added to a stack, it is placed on the top of all previously entered items. 

A stack in which items are removed from the top is considered a "LIFO" - Last in, First Out. In a "FIFO" - First In, First Out items are removed from the bottom.
