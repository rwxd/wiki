## eBGP Flying Solo
In the traditional model of deployment, BGP learns of the prefixes to advertise from another routing protocol, usually OSPF, IS-IS, or Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). These are called internal routing protocols because they are used to control routing within an enterprise. However, in the data center, eBGP is the internal routing protocol. No additional one is required.
