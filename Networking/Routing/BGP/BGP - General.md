# About BGP

BGP peering between speakers in different administrative domains (or autonomous systems in BGP parlance) is called external BGP (eBGP). BGP peering between speakers within an administrative domain (or within the same autonomous system) is called internal BGP (iBGP). BGP has different rules for eBGP peering and iBGP peering.
