BGP route advertisements carry little Post-it notes. These Post-it notes are called BGP path attributes. There are different kinds of attributes, depending on their use and semantics. Attributes are encoded using the well-known Type, Length, and Value (TLV) model.

The base BGP-4 RFC defines seven path attributes that every compliant implementation must support. These attributes are used in BGPâ€™s best path computation.
