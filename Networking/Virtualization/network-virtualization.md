# Network Virtualization

Network virtualization is the carving up of a single physical network into many virtual networks. Virtualizing a resource allows it to be shared by multiple users. Sharing allows the efficient use of a resource when no single user can utilize the entire resource.

Virtualization affords each user the illusion that they own the resource. In the case of virtual networks, each user is under the illusion that there are no other users of the network. To preserve the illusion, virtual networks are isolated from one another. Packets cannot accidentally leak from one virtual network to another.
