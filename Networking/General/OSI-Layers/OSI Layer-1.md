# Overview OSI Layer-1

**Layer 1 is anything that carries 1’s and 0’s between two nodes.**

The actual format of the data on the “wire” can vary with each medium. In the case of Ethernet, bits are transferred in the form of electric pulses.

In the case of Wifi, bits are transferred in the form of radio waves. In the case of Fiber, bits are transferred in the form of pulses of light.

- A Repeater simply repeats a signal from one medium to the other, allowing a series of cables to be daisy chained together and increase the range a signal can travel beyond the single cable limit. These are commonly used in large WiFi deployments, where a single WiFi network is “repeated” throughout multiple access-points to cover a larger range.

- A Hub is simply a multi-port Repeater. If four devices are connected to a single Hub, anything sent by one device gets repeated to the other three.
