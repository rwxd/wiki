# Overview OSI Layer-2

**The Data Link layer of the OSI model is responsible for interfacing with the Physical layer.**

**Effectively, Layer 2 is responsible for putting 1’s and 0’s on the wire, and pulling 1’s and 0’s from the wire.**

The Network Interface Card (NIC) that you plug your Ethernet wire into handles the Layer 2 functionality. It receives signals from the wire, and transmits signals on to the wire.

Your WiFi NIC works the same way, receiving and transmitting radio waves which are then interpreted as a series of 1’s and 0’s.

**Layer 2 will then group together those 1’s and 0’s into chunks known as Frames.**
