# NSX-T Management Plane
In the Management Plane resides the NSX-T Manager. The Manager provides a wide view of everything involved in NSX-T and is the API entry point.

The manager pushes the desired configuration to the [[Control Plane]].

Every NSX-T component has a MPA (Management Plane Agent) that connects the components back to the NSX-T Manager.
